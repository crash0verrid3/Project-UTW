PROJECT TITLE: Project UTW
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Simple, lightweight web browser that won't leak memory and will be easy to use proxies with
VERSION or DATE: 10/8/2015
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: run 'main(String[])' in class 'SimpleSwingBrowser' or double-click the JAR file
AUTHORS: Alex Anderson
USER INSTRUCTIONS:
To run, double-click the JAR file.
To set a proxy, type the following into the URL bar:
    proxy: [proxy host]:[proxy port] > [continue url]
or
    proxy: [proxy host]:[proxy port]
or
    proxy: [proxy keyword] > [continue url]
or
    proxy: [proxy keyword]
If [continue url] is not specified, it defaults to http://google.com
[proxy keyword] can be one of the following:
    none
        - No proxy
    default
        - Default proxy server (46.216.1.99:3128 as of 10/7/2015)
The proxy must be an HTTP proxy.

This browser will not keep browsing history, but cannot prevent any websites you visit from tracking you.
The proxy *should* keep you anonymous when browsing.

Upon runtime, the 'default' proxy will be used. This can be changed any time.
